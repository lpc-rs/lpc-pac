# lpc546
This crate provides an autogenerated API for access to LPC546XX peripherals.
The API is generated using [svd2rust] with patched svd files containing
extensive type-safe support. For more information please see the [main repo].
Refer to the [documentation] for full details.

## Usage
Each device supported by this crate is behind a feature gate so that you only
compile the device(s) you want. To use, in your Cargo.toml:
```toml
[dependencies.lpc546xx-pac]
version = "0.2.0"
features = ["lpc54605"]
```
The `rt` feature is enabled by default and brings in support for `cortex-m-rt`.
To disable, specify `default-features = false` in `Cargo.toml`.
In your code:
```rust
use lpc546xx-pac::lpc54605;
let mut peripherals = lpc54605::Peripherals::take().unwrap();
let gpio = &peripherals.gpio;
```
