# Bash script to (re)generate Platform Access Crates (PACs) with svd2rust.
# For PAC to be generated, the following items are required:
#
# - It needs to be registered below in the `PACS` array.
# - The directory needs to contain an SVD file with the name matching
#   the crate name.

set -euo pipefail


### Configuration

PACS=(
    lpc11uxx
    lpc176x5x
    # NOTE(hannobraun):
    # lpc82x has not been added here, since it doesn't include an SVD file, for
    # copyright reasons. I figured extending this script to support this is not
    # worth it, since the current situation is good enough(tm). Also, the newer
    # versions of the LPC82x SVD files are BSD-licensed, so if NXP ever gets
    # around to fixing those, we can just include LPC82x here normally.
)

# everything is relative to the generate script
cd "$(dirname "$0")"
